# Topics to teach

1. Indentation
   This is mandatory in Python. Use 2 spaces, or use 4 spaces, or use tabs, but be consistent.
1. Comments
   A line beginning with "`#`", or from "`#`" to the end of the line.
1. `print()` statement
   Output something on the screen, with/without a newline character.
1. Strings
   A piece of text, zero or more characters, surrounded by double quotes (`"..."`).
1. Variables
   A named piece of storage which can contain a number, a string, or an array.
1. Boolean
   `True` or `False`. Used in `if` and `while` statements.
1. Arrays
   An ordered list of items, usually of the same type. Indexed with a number, starting at zero, e.g. `myarray[0]`
1. `range(n)` - return a list from zero up to `n-1`.
1. Equals
   A single equals is for assignment, e.g. `x = 5` take `5` and stores it in the memory location named `x`.

   A double equals is for comparison, e.g. `x == 5` checks if `x` is `5`, and returns `True` or `False`
1. Functions
   A block of code which can be called from anywhere. It may take some inputs (arguments) and may return some information.
1. `for` loop
   Iterate through a list of things, setting a temporary variable to the current list item.
